    "# Week 2 - Sampling & Reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until this week, we have assumed that the corpus you have used for analysis assignments represented a *meaningful* assemblage of texts from which reasonable inferences could be drawn about the social game, social world and social actors that produced it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we ask you to build a corpus for preliminary analysis and articulate what your sample represents in context of your final project. We begin by exploring how we can get *human* readings of content at scale. We want to gather and utilize human responses for several reasons. First, we may want to use crowdsourced human scores as the primary method of coding, extracting or organizing content (as it was in two of the assigned readings). Second, we may want to validate or tune a computational algorithm we may have developed in terms of how it is associated with human meanings or experience. Finally, we may want to use human coding on a sample of data as the basis for training a model or algorithm to then extrapolate *human-like* annotations to the entire population. Here intelligent sampling is critical to maximize effective maching training. \n",

    "I plan on analyzing the movie corpus. My broad plan is to merge the movie script corpus with information on IMDb scores and reviews as well as box-office revenue information. IMDb information from IMDb's data website - \"contains the IMDb rating and votes information for titles\". Might also use this 5000 movie dataset that has more information beyond just scores and revenue. This is in order to predict what would be an ideal/ lucrative script - i.e. what genre of scripts, kind of characters, gender relationships, length, common themes, common titles, potentially actors and directors and trends between different decades. The primary analysis will be based on the scripts and use frequency as well as context of word usage in the script.  I hopr to use topic modeling to identify features of the scripts and once I figure out several important themes and topics (might overlap with genres perhaps), I will collect the scripts that relate to these topics. Then, I will try to see if any general overlapping sentiment score can be calculated for the scripts."

    "I think this would be an interesting data analysis project as far as entertainment and movie analysis is concerned. I am taking a class on the economics of cultural policy and ran the idea by my professor and he suggested that it would be helpful since there isn't much broad script analysis done. The results would be helpful to movie conglomerates to know more definitely what kind of script themes and movies tend to do better at the box office. I would anticipate it is the more mass-produced marvel films in recent times for example but the data might help put this in the context of all different types of movies."

    "I am seeking to make inferences about the movie industry as well as preferences of the public as far as type of scripts are concerned. Comparing the male and female characters in the most lucrative films will inform us about the general disparity in the kinds of movies that tend to see box office success. My primary concern/ the potential limitations are parsing through the context of the texts, and unlike the soap opera corpus, the movie corpus does not have indicators for which character is speaking. Also, the count by years is different so sampling based on years might not be the best option. I might to need to resort to either convenience or relevance sampling depending on the inflation adjusted box office revenue that is available or based on the script count focus my analysis on a particular genre. From the IMDb dataset, I was able to find score and revenue information for 5000 films but need to check the overlap with the scripts I have available. A reasonable path to scale up would be to also include the TV corpus information to check overlap between movie and TV information which might add some interesting nuances. Also, the movie corpus is limtied to just Hollywood films which are largely English speaking so any analysis will shed light only on Western movie ideals and concepts in the broadest sense. Potentially adding other film industries like Bollywood or Nollywood would be a good way to scale up the analysis."

    "Load Rzhetsky et al (2009)'s sample dataset, which can be found [here](https://github.com/enthought/uchicago-pyanno/tree/master/data). This data is the result of a content analytic / content extraction study in which Andrey Rzhetsky and colleagues from the National Library of Medicine, published [here](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000391) in [PLOS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/), gave eight annotators 10,000 sentence chunks from biomedical text in biomedical abstracts and articles, then asked them, in a loop design schematically illustrated below that provided 3 independent codings for each document. The sampling strategy pursued diversity by drawing from PubMed abstracts (1000) and full-text articles (9000: 20% from abstracts, 10% from introductions, 20% from methods, 25% from results, and 25% from discussions.) The dataset extract here involves respondents codes for sentences in terms of their *Evidence*: {0, 1, 2, 3, -1} where 0 is the complete lack of evidence, 3 is direct evidence present within the sentence, and -1 is didn't respond. (They also crowdsourced and analyzed *polarity*, *certainty*, and *number*). For example, consider the following two abutting sentence chunks: *\"Because null mutations in toxR and toxT abolish CT and TcpA expression in the El Tor biotype and also attenuate virulence...\"* [i.e., average certainty = 0], *\"...it is likely that the ToxR regulon has functional similarities between the two biotypes despite the clear differences in the inducing parameters observed in vitro\"* [i.e., average certainty = 1].\""

Here, Cohen's $\\kappa$ statistic for the first two annotators is computed. This is probably the most common metric of agreement."

    "However, what if some coders are better than others. The prior measures all rely on the assumption that all coders are equally good. What if some are worse than others? Now we use Rzhetsky et al (2009) and Dawid & Skene's models to make inference about true label classes by downweighting bad or deviant coders. Pyanno provides three relevant models: ModelA, ModelB, and ModelBt. Model A can only be currently run on a balanced 8-coder design, but assesses accuracy purely based on agreement. Model B with $\\theta$s models the relationship between each coder and code. Model B is the Dawid & Skene model from the reading. The following image schematically suggests the relationship between the models. <img src=\"../data/models.png\">"
